🚀 Project Title: Personal Resume Login Page 🔐.

This project is a creative and interactive login-based personal resume page designed to showcase your identity as a budding developer in a secure and stylish way. 💼✨

🧑‍💻 Users are welcomed with a sleek login interface featuring username and password inputs, 🔒 an eye icon to toggle password visibility 👁, and social login options using Facebook, Google, and Twitter 🌐.

🎨 The UI is powered with a gradient background, responsive design, and smooth animations, making it visually attractive on all screen sizes 📱💻. You’ve also added cool icons using Font Awesome and customized styling for a professional touch 🎯.

🛡 Instead of a traditional boring login, you’re experimenting with a “🔑 enter the code to proceed” idea to add an extra layer of uniqueness and curiosity — making your portfolio feel like an exclusive experience! 🧠💡

📁 After successful login, users are redirected to your resume or portfolio page, where you can showcase your skills, projects, and achievements.

🔥 This project blends HTML + CSS + JavaScript skills into one neat package, demonstrating your growth as a frontend developer and showing off your creativity and attention to user experience!
